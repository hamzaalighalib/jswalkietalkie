## SEO ideas to go viral

Use these phrases in README, repo description, and your website:

- Repo description:  
  `Real‑time browser walkie‑talkie using JavaScript, WebSockets, and Node.js. Open the page and talk with anyone instantly.`  
- Add tags in README:  
  `walkie talkie`, `browser walkie talkie`, `javascript websocket`, `voice chat`, `open source`, `nodejs audio chat`.  
- Create a small demo page (GitHub Pages or Vercel) and link it from README with a GIF showing two tabs talking.  
- Share in communities: r/javascript, r/webdev, Dev.to, Twitter/X, and relevant Discord servers with a short video demo.
